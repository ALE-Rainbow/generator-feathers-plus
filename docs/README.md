# @feathers-plus/cli a.k.a. cli-plus

The cli-plus is similar to @feathersjs/cli in that:
- It uses the same commends, e.g. `generate service`.
- It prompts with the same questions, e.g. "Which path should the service be registered on?"
- It generates the same modules with pretty much identical code.
